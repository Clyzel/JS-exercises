// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let i = 1;
while (i < 6) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}


// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let a = 1;
do {
  console.log (a);
  a++
} while (a < 6)



// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

for (let b = 1; b < 6; b++) {
  console.log(b);
}





// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

for (let countdown = 10; countdown > 0; countdown--){
  console.log(countdown);
}

let down = 10;
while (down > 0) {
  console.log(down);
  down--;
}

let e = 11;
do {
  e--;
  console.log(e);
} while (e > 1);


// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

for (let fab = 7; fab < 28; fab++) {
  console.log(fab);
}

let great = 7;
while (great < 28) {
  console.log(great);
  great++;
}

let hola = 7;
do {
  console.log(hola);
  hola++;
} while (hola < 28);


// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

let justnumbers = 0;
while (justnumbers < 100) {
  justnumbers += 10;
  console.log(justnumbers);
}

for (let k = 10; k < 101; k += 10) {
  console.log(k);
}

let letsCount = 0;
do {
  letsCount += 10;
  console.log(letsCount);
} while (letsCount < 100);

// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

/* The reason for the inifinite loop is because of the increment. At first it was counterFour--, once I changed it to ++ it only output 1 "HELP ME." */

let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour > -100) {
  console.log(counterFour);
  counterFour--;
}

// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.

let bestNum = 7;
for (let m = 0; m < 8; m++) {
  console.log(m);
}




// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)

let favNum = 7;
let n = 0;
do {
  if (n === 7){
    console.log(n + " my favorite number!")
  } else {
    console.log(n + " not my favorite number")
  }
  n++;
} while (n < 101);


// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:
//

/* From my research and practice, for loops should be done for known outputs ( such as knowing it needs to loop x times) and number iterations. While loops best suit loops based on conditions or unknown amount of loops needed.*/



// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) {
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter >= 1; insideCounter-- ) {
    console.log("inside", insideCounter);
  }
  console.log("***********************************");
}

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
/// I found it to be a little complicated, but not too hard. I mainly googled, freecodecamp and watched Youtube videos on how to correctly do the nested for loop.
